# CHESS GAME
## A chess game written in Python where all the pieces can move by global rules
## explained in WikiPedia. For all pieces, classes are created and the pieces are
## seen at objects moving in the chessboard. 

## The game is constructed by 9 classes which are:
* Chessboard class- displaying the board and updating after every move.
* Position class- stores the positions of each piece in the board.
* Chessfigure class- Parent class of all the pieces' classes.
* Bishop, King, Knight, Pawn, Queen, Rook classes which inherit from chessfigure class but have also their own methods.

# Game can be started by running the Game.py file in the project.
